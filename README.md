# Applied-Internship-on-site-Big-Data-Market-Statistics-Morocco-
During this 2 months internship, I worked on analyzing large datasets related to Moroccan markets. Tasks included data cleaning, processing, and statistical analysis to identify economic and commercial trends. This experience strengthened my skills in data analysis, statistics, and interpreting results to support decision-making.
# 📊 Analysis of Moroccan Public Markets (2021–2025)

## 🧠 Project Topic
Intelligent exploitation of Moroccan public markets data: statistical and temporal analysis from the official portal [marchespublics.gov.ma](https://www.marchespublics.gov.ma)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
Collect, structure, and analyze public procurement data published between 2021 and 2025, applying techniques such as:

- Descriptive statistics  
- Multivariate analysis (PCA, clustering)  
- Time series analysis (forecasting, seasonality)  
- Interactive visualization (dashboard)

## 🧩 Work Plan

### I. 📥 Data Collection and Structuring
- Web scraping from [marchespublics.gov.ma](https://www.marchespublics.gov.ma)  
- Cleaning raw data (Python + Pandas)  
- Building a structured dataset  
- Encoding qualitative variables  

### II. 📊 Exploratory Analysis
- Global statistics: annual distribution, by region, by buyer  
- Visualizations: histograms, heatmaps  
- Typology of markets by sector and category  

### III. 🧮 Advanced Statistical Analysis
- PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical) to profile typical markets  
- Cross-analysis: buyer-type-object  

### IV. 📈 Temporal Analysis and Modeling
- Time series analysis (ARIMA, moving averages…)  
- Seasonality detection  
- Forecasting future market volume  

### V. 📊 Visualization and Dashboard
- Creation of an interactive dashboard (Power BI, R, Python)  
- Filterable visualizations (region, year, type…)  
- Export of results
